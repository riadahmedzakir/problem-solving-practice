# Polling
Polling is a common technique used in software development for obtaining information or updates from a source or system at regular intervals. It involves repeatedly checking or querying the source to see if there are any new changes or data available. Here's a more detailed elaboration of polling:

- `Regular Check for Updates`: Polling involves setting up a predefined interval at which the requesting component, known as the client or poller, regularly checks the source or system for updates. The interval can be a fixed time period or based on a specific schedule.

- `Requesting Data or Status`: The client sends a request to the source or system, typically in the form of an API call or query, to fetch the desired information. This request may include parameters or filters to specify the type or scope of data being requested.

- `Receiving Response`: The source or system processes the client's request and responds with the requested data or a status indicating whether there are any updates available. The response can be in various formats such as JSON, XML, or plain text.

`Analyzing Response`: The client receives the response and analyzes it to determine if there are any new updates or relevant information available. It may parse the response, extract specific data, or compare it with previously obtained data to identify changes.

`Repeat Cycle`: After analyzing the response, the client waits for the next scheduled interval and initiates another request to the source or system. This cycle of requesting, receiving, and analyzing is repeated until the desired condition or termination criteria are met.

`Efficiency Considerations`: Polling introduces a trade-off between responsiveness and resource utilization. Shorter polling intervals allow for more real-time updates but increase the load on the source or system and consume more resources. Longer intervals reduce the load but may lead to delays in receiving updates.

`Long Polling`: In some scenarios, traditional polling may not be efficient, especially when updates are infrequent or irregular. Long polling is an alternative approach where the client holds the request open for an extended period until an update is available or a timeout occurs. This reduces the number of unnecessary requests and provides more immediate updates when they occur.
