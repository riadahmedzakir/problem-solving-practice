# Multiplexing - Demultiplexing
Multiplexing and demultiplexing are techniques used in networking and communication systems to combine multiple data streams into a single transmission channel and then separate them back into their original streams at the receiving end. These techniques help optimize the utilization of network resources and enable efficient communication between multiple sources and destinations. Here's a more detailed elaboration of multiplexing and demultiplexing:

## Multiplexing:

- Multiplexing is the process of combining multiple data streams or signals into a single transmission channel or medium.
- It allows multiple sources to share the same network or communication medium simultaneously.
- Multiplexing is commonly used in telecommunications, computer networks, and multimedia systems.

Types of Multiplexing:

- `Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)`: In TDM, the available transmission channel is divided into fixed time slots, and each source is assigned a specific time slot. Each source takes turns transmitting their data during their allocated time slot.
- `Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)`: FDM assigns a unique frequency range to each source, allowing them to transmit simultaneously. The frequencies are separated, and the receiver uses filters to extract the individual signals.
- `Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)`: WDM is used in optical fiber communication systems. It multiplexes multiple optical signals of different wavelengths (colors) onto a single fiber, enabling high-capacity data transmission.

Advantages of Multiplexing:

- Efficient Utilization of Resources: Multiplexing optimizes the use of network resources by allowing multiple signals or data streams to share the same channel.
- Cost Savings: Multiplexing reduces the need for dedicated channels for each source, leading to cost savings in infrastructure and equipment.
- Increased Bandwidth: By combining multiple data streams into a single transmission channel, multiplexing increases the overall bandwidth available for communication.

## Demultiplexing:

Demultiplexing is the reverse process of multiplexing. It involves separating the combined data stream back into its original individual streams.
Demultiplexing is performed at the receiving end of the transmission, where the combined signal is received.

Demultiplexing Techniques:

- `Time Division Demultiplexing`: In TDM, demultiplexing is done by assigning each time slot to the corresponding receiver, allowing them to extract their specific data.
- `Frequency or Wavelength Demultiplexing`: Demultiplexing in FDM or WDM involves separating the combined signal into its constituent frequencies or wavelengths using filters or optical components.

Application Examples:

- In telecommunications, multiplexing is used to combine voice, video, and data streams for transmission over a single network.
- In computer networks, multiplexing allows multiple data packets from different sources to be combined and transmitted over a shared network link.
- In multimedia systems, multiplexing is employed to combine audio, video, and other media components into a single stream for broadcasting or storage.
- Multiplexing and demultiplexing are essential techniques in various communication systems. They enable efficient utilization of network resources, increase bandwidth capacity, and facilitate the simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams.
