# The push design pattern 
The push design pattern, also known as the observer or publish-subscribe pattern, is a software architectural pattern that enables efficient communication and coordination between components by establishing a one-to-many relationship between them. In this pattern, a component, called the publisher or subject, maintains a list of other components, known as subscribers or observers, that are interested in receiving updates or notifications about specific events or data changes.

Here is an elaboration of the push design pattern:

- `Publisher-Subscriber Relationship`: The pattern establishes a loose coupling between the publisher and subscribers. The publisher is responsible for maintaining a list of subscribers and notifying them of relevant events or changes. Subscribers, on the other hand, register themselves with the publisher and define the events they are interested in.

- `Event or Data Notifications`: The publisher generates and sends notifications to all registered subscribers when a relevant event or change occurs. This can be a specific action, a state change, or an update to some data. The publisher doesn't have detailed knowledge of the subscribers; it simply broadcasts the notifications to all registered observers.

- `Registration and Unregistration`: Subscribers typically register themselves with the publisher by providing relevant information or callbacks that should be invoked upon receiving notifications. They can also unregister or unsubscribe when they no longer require updates.

- `Asynchronous Communication`: The push design pattern often utilizes asynchronous communication. The publisher doesn't wait for a response or acknowledgment from subscribers. It simply sends out notifications and allows subscribers to handle them asynchronously in their own time and manner.

- `Decoupling and Scalability`: This pattern promotes loose coupling between publishers and subscribers, enabling components to evolve independently. Publishers and subscribers don't have direct dependencies on each other, making it easier to add or remove new components without affecting the existing ones. This decoupling also contributes to the scalability and maintainability of the system.

- `Event-driven and Reactive Systems`: The push design pattern is commonly used in event-driven and reactive systems. It allows components to react to events or changes in real-time, enabling dynamic and responsive behavior.
