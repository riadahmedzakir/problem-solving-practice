# Request Response 

The request-response communication design pattern is a commonly used approach for exchanging information between different components or systems. In this pattern, one component, known as the client or requester, initiates a request for some specific action or data from another component, known as the server or responder. The server then processes the request and sends back a response to the client.

- `Client sends a request`: The client initiates the communication by sending a request to the server. The request contains information about the action or data needed, typically in the form of a structured message or API call.

- `Server processes the request`: Upon receiving the request, the server interprets and processes the information. This may involve performing some computation, accessing a database, or interacting with other systems to fulfill the request.

- `Server generates a response`: Once the server has completed the necessary processing, it generates a response containing the requested data or confirmation of the action performed. The response is typically formatted in a predefined structure, such as JSON or XML.

- `Client receives the response`: The client waits for the server's response and receives it once it arrives. The client can then extract and utilize the relevant data from the response or take appropriate action based on the response content.

- `Synchronous or asynchronous communication`: Request-response communication can occur in either a synchronous or asynchronous manner. In synchronous communication, the client waits for the server's response before proceeding further. In asynchronous communication, the client continues its operation while the server processes the request, and the response may be received later through a callback mechanism.

- `Error handling and status codes`: The request-response pattern includes mechanisms for handling errors and indicating the status of the operation. The server may return status codes, such as HTTP status codes, to indicate the success or failure of the request, allowing the client to handle different scenarios appropriately.
