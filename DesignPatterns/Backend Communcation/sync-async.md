# Synchronous and asynchronous workload

## Synchronous Workloads:

- In synchronous workloads, tasks are executed in a sequential and blocking manner.
- When a task is initiated, the program waits until the task is completed and a response is received before proceeding to the next task.
- Synchronous workloads are characterized by a direct and immediate response, where the program execution is halted until a response is obtained.
- This approach simplifies the code logic as tasks are executed in a predictable order, but it can result in longer overall execution times if tasks are time-consuming or if the program needs to wait for external resources.

## Asynchronous Workloads:

- In asynchronous workloads, tasks are initiated and executed independently without blocking the program's execution flow.
When a task is initiated, the program continues executing other tasks without waiting for the completion or response of the previous task.
- Asynchronous workloads allow for concurrent execution of multiple tasks, making more efficient use of system resources.
The program can continue with other operations or initiate additional tasks while waiting for responses from previous tasks.
- Asynchronous workloads are commonly used when tasks involve network communication, I/O operations, or other potentially time-consuming operations.
- Asynchronous programming often involves the use of callbacks, promises, or async/await mechanisms to handle the responses or completion of tasks.
