# CDN (Content delivery network)

## What is a CDN?

A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 

## Benefits of using CDN

- Improving website load times - By distributing content closer to website visitors by using a nearby CDN server (among other optimizations), visitors experience faster page loading times. As visitors are more inclined to click away from a slow-loading site, a CDN can reduce bounce rates and increase the amount of time that people spend on the site. In other words, a faster a website means more visitors will stay and stick around longer.
- Reducing bandwidth costs - Bandwidth consumption costs for website hosting is a primary expense for websites. Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing hosting costs for website owners.
- Increasing content availability and redundancy - Large amounts of traffic or hardware failures can interrupt normal website function. Thanks to their distributed nature, a CDN can handle more traffic and withstand hardware failure better than many origin servers.
- Improving website security - A CDN may improve security by providing DDoS mitigation, improvements to security certificates, and other optimizations.

## Typs of CDN

- Push CDN - When a content is uploaded, it automatically uploads it to all the cdn.
- Pull CDN - When a content is requested, if the cdn doesn't have it yet, it will go to the server to get the file and cache it for the next request.
